A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/neos-modding-group/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that fixes the ["stuck sync"](https://wiki.neosvr.com/Stuck_Sync) issue and is provided as a solution for [#3915](https://github.com/Neos-Metaverse/NeosPublic/issues/3915) on NeosPublic. Additionally, this mod contains an automatic retry sync feature that will retry a failed sync based on the specific failure state.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [JworkzNeosFixFrickenSync.dll](https://github.com/stiefeljackal/JworkzNeosFixFrickenSync/releases/latest/download/JworkzNeosFixFrickenSync.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be located in the same folder as Neos. For a default installation, the typical location is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods`. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working, you can check your Neos logs.

# The True Explanation of Stuck Sync

Although the NeosVR wiki makes it sound like a "stuck sync" is a normal thing in Neos, this is not the case. The unfortunate truth behind the "Stuck Sync" issue is due to a bug in the sync loop where
unhandled exceptions (aka errors) are not being handled within the sync loop, causing the loop to stop. The most common exception thrown is one where the upload task is being marked as complete twice when a sync
failure occurs due to the Neos Cloud returning an HTTP error code. Because tasks cannot be marked complete more than once, an exception is thrown within the loop that causes the loop to stop.

Syncing errors should occur normally, but they should not be halting other sync tasks. If this bug was addressed, then the follow status would be shown:
